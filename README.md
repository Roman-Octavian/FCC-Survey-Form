This took longer than expected because I forgot to add a closing tag to certain elements and that messed everything up quite badly. It took me hours to figure out what was going wrong and to fix the mess I made whilst troubleshooting. By the way, apparently I'm not supposed to push too many commits to GitHub, so I'll try to be a bit more conservative from now on in that regard.
