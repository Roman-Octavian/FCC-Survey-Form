# SURVEY FORM

This is the second project for the Responsive Web Design Certificate offered by FreeCodeCamp. It took me longer than expected because I forgot to add a closing tag to certain elements and it messed everything up so badly that it took me hours to fix everything, which is why I won't put any more effort into making it responsive or prettier. The user stories were completed long ago anyways so I'd rather move on to the next project. By the way, apparently I'm not supposed to push useless commits to GitHub, so I'll try to be a bit more conservative from now on in that regard.
